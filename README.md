# 👋 Hey there, I’m Ana

🧠 Curious | 🎮 Gamer | 🧪 Builder | 💻 Code Witch

I'm a developer who loves blending creativity with code. I'm currently working on:

- 🐉 [**Monster Dex**](https://github.com/anapaltami/pf2_mondex) – A desktop app to explore and compare Pathfinder monster data. Designed to simplify GM prep and make browsing monster traits way less painful.
- 🃏 **StateCraftCG** – A modern digital card game with realistic physics, AI opponents, and multiplayer support. Built in Unity with modular mechanics for future expansion.
- 🌾 [**Farm Clicker**](https://github.com/Enchanted-Pixelwork-Studios/FarmClicker) – A mobile idle game with zoomable UI and tool-based progression. Developed in Java with Android Studio.
- 🌌 **Custom Start Tab** – A personalized browser homepage inspired by Momentum Dash. Featuring space themes, quote decks, Pomodoro timers, offline-first storage, and more.
- 🌐 **Portfolio Website** – A minimalist but powerful site to showcase my work, built from scratch using React, PostgreSQL, and GitHub Pages.

## 🔧 Tech Stack & Tools
I’m hands-on with:
- **Languages**: Python, Java, JavaScript, SQL, HTML/CSS
- **Frameworks**: React, Flask, Unity (C#), Android SDK
- **Tools**: Pandas, TensorFlow, scikit-learn, PostgreSQL, FMOD, ML-Agents, Git, VS Code, IntelliJ, PyCharm
- **OS**: Mostly Windows, sometimes Linux 🐧

## 🛠️ In Progress
These projects are all under active development and constantly evolving.
I'm focused on building flexible, modular systems that are easy to expand and maintain over time.

## 🎲 Fun Facts
- I love Pathfinder and want to design tools to support tabletop play.
- I never use website builders—I like to understand and control every layer of my stack.
- I care about thoughtful architecture, clean design, and keeping the codebase future-proof.
